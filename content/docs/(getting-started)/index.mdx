### Sharpen your tools. Hone your instincts. Claim your bounties.

This is where raw skill meets engineered precision — a battle-tested toolkit forged in real bug bounty trenches. No fluff. No filler. Just lethal efficiency distilled into commands, workflows, and trade secrets that separate hunters from script kiddies.

### Warning:

Extended use of Penquin may result in:

• Faster triage - Your notes app will miss you

• More $$$ in your wallet - Your bank will ask uncomfortable questions

• Increased productivity - Your Netflix queue will grow neglected

• Unreasonable confidence - You'll start eyeballing Fortune 500 assets

• Tool dependency - "How did I ever hack without this?" syndrome


### Contraindications:

Do not use Penquin if you:

• Prefer doing things the hard way.

• Are allergic to efficient hacking.

• Enjoy manual recon.


### Disclaimer:

We are not responsible for any:

• Increased bug bounty earnings

• Expanded attack surface awareness

• Career advancement in cybersecurity


### Why This Hits Different:

• Pre-built commands that slice through recon like a hot knife through butter. Why type when you can hunt?

• Optimized attack chains that turn chaotic probing into a surgical strike. Less noise, more exploits.

• A handpicked arsenal of techniques, tricks, and gotchas — crowdsourced from elite hunters and polished to a razor's edge.


### Architects of Chaos:

• [Sibhi](https://xibhi.github.io) – The reason Penquin doesn't just exist — it dominates.

• [Krish](https://crish-xi.vercel.app) – The code alchemist. Turns caffeine into clean execution and "it should work" into "it fucking works."

This isn't some corporate-approved "security solution" built by a faceless team. It's a weaponized workflow forged by two hunters who got tired of doing things the hard way. No committees. No fluff. Just raw, iterative hacking — refined in the fires of real bug bounty battles.
